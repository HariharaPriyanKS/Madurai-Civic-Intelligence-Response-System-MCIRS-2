# **App Name**: Madurai Civic Intelligence & Response System (MCIRS)

## Core Features:

- Citizen Issue Reporting: Enables citizens to report issues via text, photo, or voice. Automatically detects the ward using GPS. Includes support for Tamil/English toggle and offline reporting to maximize accessibility.
- AI-Powered Issue Triage & Categorization Tool: Utilizes AI as a tool to intelligently analyze reported issues (from text, voice, and visual context) and automatically classify them into the appropriate issue categories and departments (e.g., Roads & Potholes, Solid Waste), and then map them to the correct ward and relevant authority chain.
- Dynamic Ward & Department Configuration: Provides an administrative interface to configure and manage all 100 wards with unique IDs and names. Also allows definition and management of issue categories and their corresponding multi-level departmental authority chains for efficient issue routing.
- Role-Based Authority Dashboards: Delivers secure, role-specific dashboards for key user roles including Citizens, Ward Officers, Zonal Officers, Municipal Commissioner, and District Collector, presenting relevant issue status, assigned tasks, and data visualizations tailored to their permissions.
- Automated SLA & Escalation Engine: Automatically issues an acknowledgment upon issue submission, establishes resolution deadlines, and orchestrates auto-escalation of unresolved issues through defined levels of authority (e.g., Ward Officer → Zonal Officer → Commissioner → Collector) with integrated automated alerts.
- Issue Tracking & Citizen Feedback Loop: Allows citizens to monitor the real-time status of their reported issues, view issue timelines, and observe 'Before/After' resolution proofs. Features enable citizens to reopen issues if not satisfied and to rate the quality of resolution, fostering accountability.
- Public Transparency Portal: A publicly accessible portal displaying anonymized, aggregated civic data such as ward cleanliness scorecards, SLA compliance rates, total resolved cases, and a ward performance leaderboard to promote transparency and civic engagement.

## Style Guidelines:

- A light color scheme to embody transparency and approachability suitable for public service. The primary interactive color is a professional blue (#1F66CC), selected to symbolize trust and governance. The background is a very light, subtle blue-tinted almost-white (#EEF3F7) for a clean and open canvas. The accent color, a vibrant but sophisticated aqua (#24D8D8), is used for highlights and key interactive elements to draw attention without being overwhelming.
- The primary font for both headlines and body text will be 'Inter' (sans-serif). This choice is based on its exceptional readability across various digital interfaces, its neutral yet modern aesthetic, and its versatility, making it ideal for presenting information clearly and professionally in a civic application.
- Implement a cohesive suite of clean, scalable vector icons adhering to modern UI design standards. Icons will be carefully chosen to be universally intuitive, clearly representing diverse issue categories, actions, and dashboard functionalities for a broad user base.
- The application will employ a mobile-first, responsive design to guarantee seamless usability on all devices. Dashboards will be structured with a clear information hierarchy and offer configurable widgets for authority views. PWA features such as installability, robust offline caching, and push notifications will be central to the user experience, alongside optimization for low bandwidth and a Tamil-first user interface for local relevance.
- Subtle, purposeful animations will be incorporated to provide immediate user feedback (e.g., for form submissions or data loading) and facilitate smooth, intuitive transitions between different views. Animations will serve to enhance usability and engagement without creating distractions or perceived latency.
